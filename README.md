**STEPS FOLLOWED**


•	Step 1: Open power query editor in Excel

•	Step 2: Load data into power query editor.

•	Step 3: Transform my data by checking for missing, duplicates, and inconsistent values

•	Step 4: I replaced missing sales values with the average sales value, I also removed empty rows and convert data types where necessary.

•	Step 5: Given the total sales and profit, two new columns were created namely; ‘Cost’ and ‘Selling Price’ this will enable us know the percentage of total cost relative to revenue and also the total selling price.

•	Step 6: Load and apply, this will open your data in an Excel workbook

•	Step 7: Click on the first cell in your already opened workbook, under the column title

•	Step 8: Click insert on your menu bar, select PivotTable(a dialog box would appear)

•	Step 9: From the dialog box, click "Select a table or range"

•	Step 10: Select "New worksheet" then "ok"

•	Step 11: I summarize the data using PivotTables to gain insights about the distribution of sales by brewery type or location.

•	Step 12: I created charts and visuals to better understand the data, such as:


	Bar charts for sales by brewery type.

	Scatter plots for production volume vs. sales.

	Pie charts for the percentage distribution of brewery types


**INSIGHTS**
Budweiser tend to have lower production volume at 126274units but they generate the highest revenue at 94705500, and also hold the highest price per unit of $0.594. On the other hand, Hero, although have the highest production volume, generate a lower revenue.
